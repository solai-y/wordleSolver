# wordleSolver
This is a Python script that helps you solve wordle.

# How it works
It will ask you for your guess and then it will ask for the results of the guess (was each letter grey, green or yellow).
Using this info it will narrow down the search field and tell you what possible words are left.

# Take note
For words with repeated letters (e.g. villa) if one letter is yellow and the other is grey, insert that both colours are yellow. If one color is green and the other one is grey insert that one is green and the other is yellow.
